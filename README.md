# flaskminiai, legacy weird code 
> an attempt to put a neural network on a web application (that's all the documentation)

Look at it this way, I wrote this project two years ago when I was just starting to learn flask for fun. I didn't care at all about documentation or clean code like now in the latest projects. And it's quite funny that now I felt the pain of legacy code without documentation for the first time, now I can not immediately understand exactly what's going on here, but I will remember this lesson. The main problems here is the cost of neural network resources, figure out how to optimize this as much as possible based on the code you got, it's interesting and the only thing this repository can be useful for you :)
